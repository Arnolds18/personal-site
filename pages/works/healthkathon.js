        I led a team of three in a national competition to create 
        a Power BI dashboard analyzing a massive dataset, 
        securing a top-5 national ranking. As the team leader, 
        I started by organizing our workflow, assigning tasks 
        based on each memberâ€™s strengths, including data 
        extraction and cleaning, model development, 
        and dashboard design.

      I ensured clear communication through regular 
        updates and collaborative problem-solving sessions, 
        especially when tackling challenges with data 
        inconsistencies and optimization. By emphasizing 
        efficiency and creativity, we delivered a polished 
        dashboard that highlighted actionable insights, 
        impressing the judges with both its technical depth 
        and usability.
